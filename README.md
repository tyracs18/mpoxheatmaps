# Automated Mpox Heatmap Creation
**Overview**
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that analyze targeted sites using heat map visualizations. The project aims to provide insights into geographic distributions and patterns in the data.

Notebooks
**BaselineHeatMap_240405.ipynb**:
This notebook establishes a baseline heat map of the initial dataset. It includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, and generating a heat map that visualizes the geographic distribution of sites.
Key components: Data import and cleaning, Baseline heat map generation, and Visualization of site density

**TargetedSitesHeatMap_240416.ipynb**:
This notebook focuses on targeted sites based on specific criteria. It builds upon the baseline analysis to highlight the targeted sites on a heat map.
Key components: Filtering data to identify targeted sites, Creating an enhanced heat map with targeted overlays, and Comparison with baseline results to show improvements or changes
